            Synopsis
        </h4>
        <p>
        <p>Mark Grayson is a normal high school senior with a normal part-time job whose father, Nolan Grayson, is the alien 
        (but human-appearing) Omni-Man, the most powerful superhero on the planet. At age 17, Mark begins to display superpowers, 
        which come from his father being a member of the Viltrumite race, who, according to Nolan, pioneer the galaxy on a mission 
        of benevolence and enlightenment.</p>
        <p>Initially the first three volumes focuses on Mark as Invincible, begins working as a superhero 
        with his father acting as his mentor, and meeting other heroes (including Robot, Rex Splode, Dupli-Kate and Atom Eve). 
        His exploits range from discovering that his physics teacher has been turning his students into human bombs, to foiling a plan
        by the Mauler Twins to make an army of robots. Meanwhile, Omni-Man is kidnapped by aliens, taken to another dimension. 
        He returns after what seems to be only a few days but was actually eight months to him.</p>
        <p>The story explores various arcs such as when Mark travels to alternate dimensions, and fights Thragg to determine Earth's fate.
